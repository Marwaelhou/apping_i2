# Quizz 1

By educating people on how to use their website, DaniWeb's team want them to use it more often and more efficiently.

They want them to use it more often because it creates content for DaniWeb. Indeed, they are a helping forum, which needs a huge community to answer to people's questions.
They also need a bigger community to create content such as tutorial, etc.

DaniWeb's team also need their users to be more efficient (by knowing the moderation policy, or where to find resources...) so that their moderators spend less time moderating errors from their users.

As DaniWeb's team say in the beginning of this email extract, they want to inform their users.

They have been receiving questions about their website, so they know that their users need some information.

They need to explain them where some features are (support, suggestions, feedback...) and what is their moderation policy.

In the last paragraph, DaniWeb also asks for its users' feedback regarding how and why they use its website.

They used frequently asked questions to create their email.

So they first talk about where to find support, where to post suggestions and feedback, and then they answer to how to edit my post and how to not be considered as spam by moderators.

All those answers enable them to educate their users and make them use DaniWeb more efficiently on the one hand, and make their readers answer their questions from the last paragraph on the other hand.

Indeed, by answering their questions, they make their readers feel like they owe DaniWeb answers as well.

DaniWeb can then educate their users so that they do not have to moderate as much as they did, and get feedback in the same time.

For each generality, DaniWeb explain how they handle things, and what are their policies.

So first, they explain where users can find support, where they can post suggestions and feedback.

Then, they explain how to report posts on the forum, how to edit a post and why you cannot edit it after 30 minutes.

Then they explain their spam policy, and how moderators know if a post is considered as spam or not.

And lastly, DaniWeb's team ask for people's feedback, by explaining that users need to help others as well. That way, DaniWeb will get more traffic and active users on their website.
