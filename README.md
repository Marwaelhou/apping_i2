I use [Atom's markdown-preview enchanced
plugin](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced) to correctly see
maths formulas and mermaid graphs.

It uses KaTeX and markdown-it to 'compile' in-lined LaTeX maths formulas inside
my markdown notes.

I managed to read my KaTeX markdown files with
[Makodo](https://www.madoko.net/editor.html) ! Just copy paste the course there
if you don't wanna use Atom or VSCode.

I also found that online MarkDown + KaTeX editor :
[markx](https://markx.herokuapp.com/) which works really well, even with inlined
math formulas.
